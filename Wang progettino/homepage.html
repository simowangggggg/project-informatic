<h2 id="int">Introduction of Alexander Calder</h2>
<div id="pi">
  <p>&nbsp Alexander Calder, (born July 22, 1898, Lawnton, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died November 11, 1976, New York, New York), American artist best known for his innovation of the mobile suspended sheet metal and wire assemblies that are activated in space by air currents. Visually fascinating and emotionally engaging, those sculptures—along with his monumental outdoor bolted sheet metal stabiles, which only imply movement—make Calder one of the most-recognizable and beloved modern artists.<br/>
      <p>&nbsp He also made a smaller number of sculptures in the more-traditional materials of wood and bronze and did paintings, mostly in gouache, as well as drawings, including illustrations for books, and prints, and was an inventive designer of jewelry. <br/>
