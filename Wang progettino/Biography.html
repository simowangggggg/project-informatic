  <h3>Biography</h3>
  <div id="p2">
  <p align="left">   Calder was the son and grandson of artists—his mother was the painter Nanette Calder (née Lederer; 1866–1960), his father the sculptor Alexander Stirling Calder (1870–1945), and his grandfather sculptor Alexander Milne Calder (1846–1923). Initially Calder resisted “going into the family business.” <br/>


  &nbsp His extraordinary manual dexterity, evidenced by his boyhood tinkering with hand tools in the creation of toys and other objects, recommended him to a potential career in engineering. <br/>


  &nbsp After a peripatetic childhood, relocating from Pennsylvania to Arizona, California, and New York as necessitated by his father’s commissions and teaching positions, 17-year-old Calder enrolled in the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, and received a degree in mechanical engineering in 1919.<br/>


  &nbsp In 1922, while serving aboard a ship off Central America, he had a formative experience of viewing, on opposite horizons, both the rising sun and the setting moon, opening him to ideas about the vast but precise workings of the universe that later informed both his choice of subject matter and formal decisions such as his focus on balance and movement. <br/>


   &nbsp While he worked at various jobs in his first chosen field, by 1923 Calder had decided to study art and had enrolled in classes at the Art Students League in New York City.<br/>


  &nbsp Easygoing and practical-minded, Calder was one of the few American visual artists who established himself in 1920s Paris, an era legendary for its aesthetic ferment that produced modern artists as exemplified by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró.  <br/>

 &nbsp  Calder also possessed a considerable intellect and a playful sense of humour along with his keen visual and sculptural skills. While residing in France between 1926 and 1933 (with frequent trips back to the United States and to other European countries), he was lauded as the “king of wire” for his cleverly constructed three-dimensional renderings. <br/>


 &nbsp  Using that technique, Calder turned out charming representations of birds, cows (one complete with a “cow patty”: Cow, 1929), elephants, horses, and other animals, including the extraordinary Romulus and Remus of 1928 that depicts the mythical founders of Rome being nursed by a she-wolf. He also created intricate tableaus of circus performers, a subject he had been earlier introduced to as a sketch artist for the National Police Gazette, an influential New York tabloid. <br/>


  &nbsp But Calder particularly recommended himself with his sensational full-body portraits of jazz-era dancer Josephine Baker and bust portraits of many in his Parisian artistic circle, such as Miró, composer Edgard Varèse, and socialite Kiki de Montparnasse. The making of his Kiki of Montparnasse was filmed by Pathé Cinema in 1929.<br/>
